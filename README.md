**Where Classical Games Meet Quantum Mechanics.**

Unleash the power of superposition, entanglement, and quantum interference in your browser! This collection of web-based games reimagines classic concepts with a quantum twist.

## 🎮 The Games

### 1. [Quantum Tetris](https://georglegato.github.io/Quantumtoys/quantum-tetris.html) 🧱
> *"Where Tetrominoes Exist in Superposition Until Observed"*

* **The Concept:** Tetrominoes don't just fall; they exist in superposition.
* **The Twist:** Use quantum gates (Hadamard, X, Z) to manipulate probability amplitudes. Entangle pieces with CNOT gates and choose your interpretation of quantum mechanics (Copenhagen, Many-Worlds, or Chaos).
* **Objective:** Clear lines by observing the board and collapsing the wavefunctions of your blocks.

### 2. [Quantum Zonk (Quonk)](https://georglegato.github.io/Quantumtoys/quantum-zonk.html) 🐐
> *"Navigating the Probability Space"*

* **The Concept:** A quantum game of chance and decision making.
* **The Twist:** Open doors that exist in multiple states simultaneously. Manage amplitudes, phases, and entanglement to avoid the "Zonk".
* **Objective:** Navigate the probability space to maximize your score without collapsing into a losing state.
